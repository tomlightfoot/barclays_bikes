This project is to design the "Boris Bike" system from scratch, to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

The purpose of this is to develop skills in both TDD and coding.


require './DockingStation'
dockingstation = DockingStation.new
bike = Bike.new
dockingstation.dock
